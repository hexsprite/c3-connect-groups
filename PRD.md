# Product Requirements Document: C3 Connect Groups

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for building a modern web front-end for C3 Church's Connect Groups management system. The solution will leverage Planning Center's existing infrastructure as a backend while providing a custom, user-friendly interface for church members to discover and join small groups.

### Key Objectives
- Create an intuitive interface for browsing and joining Connect Groups
- Leverage Planning Center as the data source and management system
- Minimize maintenance overhead for church staff
- Provide a seamless experience for both group leaders and members

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Limited User Experience**: Planning Center's default interface may not align with C3's branding and user experience goals
2. **Complex Navigation**: Members find it difficult to discover and join groups through existing interfaces
3. **Integration Gaps**: Need for a solution that maintains Planning Center as the source of truth while providing enhanced functionality
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Church staff need a solution that doesn't require constant technical maintenance

### Target Users
- **Church Members**: Looking to join connect groups
- **Group Leaders**: Managing their groups and member communications
- **Church Staff**: Administering the overall connect groups program
- **Visitors**: Exploring church community options

## Solution Overview

### Proposed Approaches

#### Option 1: Next.js Custom Front-End
Build a modern React-based application using Next.js that interfaces with Planning Center's API.

**Pros:**
- Full control over user experience and design
- Server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
- Flexible integration with Planning Center API
- Can implement custom features beyond Planning Center's limitations

**Cons:**
- Requires ongoing development maintenance
- Need to handle authentication and API rate limits
- More complex deployment and hosting


### Recommended Approach
Based on the requirements for flexibility and Planning Center integration depth, the **Next.js approach** is recommended as it provides the most control and scalability while using Planning Center as a headless CMS.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. Group Discovery
- **Browse All Groups**: Paginated list of all active connect groups. This is the default when the page is opened.
- **Search Functionality**: Search by name, description, or tags
- **Filtering Options**:
  - Meeting day of week
  - Meeting time (morning, afternoon, evening)
  - Location (All Locations, Downtown, Midtown, Hamilton)
  - Group type/category (Mixed, Men, Women)
- **Map View**: Browse connect groups on a map that are near me
  - Fetch user location using Geolocation API
  - Fetch nearby groups using Google Maps API

- The Preview Card for a group should include:
  - Group photos/media
  - Group name and description
  - Meeting schedule and location
  - Link to Planning Center group page

NOTE: Implementation of the connect group details page is out of scope for this PRD.

### User Stories

#### As a Church Member
- I want to easily find groups that match my interests and schedule
- I want to browse connect groups on a map that are near me

```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: React Context / Zustand
- **API Integration**: Planning Center API v2
- **Authentication**: Planning Center OAuth
- **Hosting**: Vercel or similar JAMstack platform
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 / Planning Center Analytics

### Planning Center Integration
- **Groups API**: Fetch and manage group data
- **People API**: Handle member information and registrations
- **Webhooks**: Real-time updates for group changes
- **OAuth**: Single sign-on for members
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement caching and request throttling

### Data Flow
1. User requests group data through Next.js frontend
2. Next.js API routes proxy requests to Planning Center
3. Data is cached to reduce API calls
4. Updates are pushed back to Planning Center
5. Webhooks keep data synchronized

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Time to interactive < 5 seconds
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Offline capability for viewed content

### Security
- HTTPS everywhere
- Secure API key management
- OWASP compliance
- Data encryption in transit
- Regular security audits

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation
- High contrast mode

### Scalability
- Support for 10,000+ active users
- Handle 500+ connect groups
- Concurrent registration handling
- CDN for static assets

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **User Adoption**: 60% of church members using the platform within 6 months
- **Group Participation**: 20% increase in connect group enrollment
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating from user feedback
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Page Performance**: 90+ Lighthouse score

### Measurement Methods
- Google Analytics for user behavior
- Planning Center reports for enrollment data
- User surveys and feedback forms
- Automated performance monitoring
- Error tracking and logging

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Project setup and infrastructure
- Planning Center API integration
- Basic authentication flow
- Core data models

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
- Group listing
- Responsive design implementation

### Phase 3: User Features (Week 3)
- Add all filters
- Keyword Search

### Phase 4: Map Integration (Week 4)
- Map API integration
- Geolocation functionality
- Location-based search

### Phase 5: Polish & Launch (Weeks 17-20)
- Performance optimization (caching, webhooks)

- User testing
- Documentation
- Deployment and launch

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement aggressive caching and request queuing
- **Data Sync Issues**: Build robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Performance Degradation**: Use CDN and optimize bundle sizes

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Conduct user training and create intuitive onboarding
- **Maintenance Burden**: Document thoroughly and automate where possible
- **Feature Creep**: Maintain strict MVP scope and phase additional features
